Moonstone Open Source LICENSE

1. Brief Description

    "Moonstone" means Moonstone, the end-to-end encrypted messaging link communications software developed by Noctisynth, based on the *Noctisynth Oblivion Transport Protocol*, and all of its add-on services(hereinafter referred to as "Moonstone"). This Moonstone Open Source Agreement ("this Agreement") shall be followed by all natural individuals or groups who intentionally or unintentionally attempt or are utilizing Moonstone to achieve and realize physical or non-physical value. This Agreement is made at the request of the Noctisynth  Fifth Convocation  (hereinafter referred to as the "Fifth Convocation") and follows the relevant Noctisynth agreements and protocols. The final interpretation of this agreement belongs to the Fifth Council.

    Information is one of the most important factors in the thousands of years of human civilization. Information can not only determine a person's destiny, but also determine the victory or defeat of a war, and even determine the fate of a country or even the direction of a civilization. In today's information age, information undoubtedly occupies a more important position.

    Everyone should have the sacred right to guard information and obtain true information, and any attempt to interfere with and destroy this sacred right in any way is unforgivable. In today's big network environment, everyone is facing endless threats of illegal network information hijacking and network information censorship. Moonstone aims to provide users with a highly secure information transmission environment, so that every piece of information can be technically secured.

    This agreement also follows the spirit of free software. The spirit of free software should apply to all software, and it is unethical to prohibit computer users from exercising this freedom. All computer users are exposed to the threat of malware all the time, and users have no means of verifying the security of software that is not open source. These software illegally run amok on users' computers, stealing and depriving them of information without authorization.

    We cannot tolerate the existence of such a dystopia, we must have a secure, information-symmetric platform that can freely transmit and receive information, which should be free from any possible information theft and censorship. Noctisynth and Moonstone promise to stay true to the standing information security and will not request any information from users without authorization for any reason.
